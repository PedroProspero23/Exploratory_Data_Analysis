# Exploratory_Data_Analysis (EDA)

This repository brings together my work and studies in exploratory data analysis, where I apply structured techniques to understand datasets before any form of predictive modeling or decision-making. My objective is to investigate real-world data from different sectors and transform raw information into meaningful insights through a combination of scripting, visualization, and statistical reasoning.

As someone currently studying Business Administration at the European International University in Paris and pursuing an MBA in Project Management at USP ESALQ (e-distance leraning), I see EDA as an essential bridge between technical analysis and strategic thinking. Each project I include here follows a logical workflow: loading and cleaning the data, understanding distributions and correlations, creating dynamic and static visualizations, and highlighting patterns that may impact business or operational outcomes.

To conduct these analyses, I use Python for automation, data manipulation, and plotting, supported by Power BI and Microsoft Office tools such as Excel to complement the visuals and enhance the business intelligence perspective. These tools allow me to combine clarity with precision, offering both the flexibility of code and the accessibility of interactive dashboards or spreadsheet reports.

All the content in this repository is authored by me and represents not only academic practice but also a professional commitment to growing as a data-driven thinker. As I continue to work on new datasets and challenges, this space will evolve into a more complete portfolio of applied analytical reasoning across industries like finance, agriculture, and operations.
